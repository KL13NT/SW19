# SW19
Stay with me in 2019, a small animation using HTML,CSS &amp; JS.
Hey peeps! You're free to share this without my permission, but it would be nice to leave my name included! 
It didn't take me long, couldn't afford the time for it, going through finals! 
##NOTES
This is not 100% completed. My 100% is when it's completely responsive (it isn't even 5% responsive for the given reasons), it's a bit heavy, given the sound files and stuff, I tried to reduce all sizes of everything as I could. 
###Happy holidays & merry christmas!
